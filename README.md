**Catch missed jumps** - If a player doesn't quite make their jump the game should be lenient and give them the extra height, it's doubly important with animations and hit boxes that might lift up the feet when in the air.

**Change direction quicker at apex** – Allows players to cancel a jump mid-air and go back to where they were standing, Allows better control over where they land (especially if it's a moving target), Can better get collectable when in air.
